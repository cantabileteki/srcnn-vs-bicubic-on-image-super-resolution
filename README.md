# SRCNN with sub-pixel conv VS plain bicubic interpolation on image super resolution
Respectively implement SRCNN  integrated with sub-pixel convolutions and plain bicubic interpolation on image dataset, analyze their effects and characteristics.

The image datasets we adopted are LR_bicubic/X4 dataset and DIV2K_train_HR dataset from DIVERSE 2K resolution high quality images.

This project is completed by @tahamousavi1992 and me.
